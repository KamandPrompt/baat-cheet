## Baat-Cheet (KamandPrompt) Code Of Conduct

- Expected Behavior -
  - Be friendly and patient.
  - Be welcoming. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
  - Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the KamandPrompt community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the KamandPrompt community.
  - When we disagree, try to understand why. Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and KamandPrompt is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of KamandPrompt comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.

- Unacceptable Behavior -
  - Be careful in the words that you choose. We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
    - Violent threats or language directed against another person.
    - Discriminatory jokes and language.
    - Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
    - Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
    - Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
    - Unwelcome sexual attention.
    - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
    - Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
  
- How to report unacceptable behavior?
  If any member of the club violates the above guidelines, please report to any of the club coordinators or core team members. If the report has to be against one of the core team members, please report to the coordinators. 

- What will happen if people break the above guidelines?
  If someone breaks one or more of the above guidelines, there will be penalty based on the intensity of the violation which will be decided by the Club Coordinator and/or the Faculty Advisor. This penalty includes but not limited to suspension from all club activities for some amount of time, suspension from college and/or monetory fines.
